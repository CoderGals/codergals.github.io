## 88. Merge Sorted Array

    Given two sorted integer arrays nums1 and nums2, merge nums2
    into nums1 as one sorted array.

    Note:
    1. The number of elements initialized in nums1 and nums2 are m and n respectively.
    2. You may assume that nums1 has enough space (size that is greater or
       equal to m + n) to hold additional elements from nums2.

```
   Example:

   Input: 
   nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3
   nums2 = [2,5,6],       n = 3

   Output: [1,2,2,3,5,6]

```
